# ATM System - Java Microproject

## Overview
This project is a simple Java-based ATM system. It simulates the process of creating a new user account, logging into an existing account, and performing ATM transactions like withdrawing money, checking the balance, and depositing money. The account information and transactions are stored and retrieved from a file called `Accounts.txt`.

### Features:
- **Create New Account**: A new user can create an account using the `NewATM.java` file. The system collects the following details:
  - **Holder Name**: The name of the account holder.
  - **Account Number**: A unique account number for the user.
  - **Age**: The user's age (users must be 18 or older to create an account).
  
  If the user's age is less than 18, they cannot create an account, and an error message is displayed.
  
- **User Login**: During login, the user must provide:
  - **Username**
  - **Password**
  - **4-digit ATM Code** (generated during account creation time)
  
  **Note**: The user needs to enter the 4-digit ATM code only once during their first login. If all these details match, the login is successful, and the user can proceed to perform ATM operations.
  
- **ATM Operations**: Once logged in, users can perform the following operations:
  - **Withdraw Money**
  - **Check Balance**
  - **Deposit Money**

## Project Files

### `NewATM.java`
- This file is used to create a new account for a user.
- It collects the following information from the user:
  - **Holder Name**: Name of the account holder.
  - **Account Number**: A unique account number for the user.
  - **Age**: The user's age. If the age is less than 18, the account cannot be created, and an error message will be shown.
  
  If the user is 18 or older, the account details (holder name, account number, age, and ATM code) are saved in `Accounts.txt`. This 4-digit code will be needed for logging in (Generated by the system).

### `ATM.java`
- This file allows an existing user to log in by providing:
  - **Username**
  - **Password**
  - **ATM Code** (the 4-digit code generated during account creation)
  
- After a successful login, users can perform the following operations:
  - **Withdraw**: Allows the user to withdraw money from their account.
  - **Check Balance**: Displays the current balance of the user's account.
  - **Deposit**: Allows the user to deposit money into their account.

### `Accounts.txt`
- This text file stores user account details (holder name, account number, age, ATM code, and password).
- It is used for authenticating users during login.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: You must have JDK 8 or later installed to run the program.
- **Text Editor or IDE**: A Java-compatible editor such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any text editor for editing `.java` files.
- **Command Line**: For compiling and running the Java files.

## Setup and Running Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the project files).

2. **Navigate to the project directory**.

3. **Compile the Java files**:
    ```bash
    javac NewATM.java ATM.java
    ```

4. **Run the `NewATM.java` file** to create a new account:
    ```bash
    java NewATM
    ```
    - The system will prompt you to enter and provide:
      - **Holder Name**: The name of the account holder.
      - **Account Number**: A unique account number for the user.
      - **Age**: The user's age. If the age is less than 18, the account cannot be created, and an error message will be shown.
      - **ATM Code**: A random 4-digit code is generated by the system, which will be displayed and saved for login.
      
    - If the user is 18 or older, the system will save the account details (holder name, account number, age, and ATM code) in the `Accounts.txt` file.

5. **Run the `ATM.java` file** to log in and perform ATM operations:
    ```bash
    java ATM
    ```
    - Enter your **Username**, **Password**, and the **4-digit ATM Code** (provided to you at the time of account creation).
    - If all details match, you will successfully log in and be able to:
      - Withdraw money
      - Check balance
      - Deposit money

6. **Check the `Accounts.txt` file** to view stored account information.

## Example Workflow

1. **Create New Account**:
   - You run `NewATM.java`, input your holder name, account number, age, and the system generates a random 4-digit ATM code for you (e.g., `1234`).
   - If your age is 18 or older, the account details are stored in `Accounts.txt`:
     ```
     JohnDoe
     12345678 
     25 
     1234 
     password123
     ```
   - If your age is less than 18, the system will display an error message:
     ```
     Account creation failed: You must be 18 or older. Come back after you turn 18.
     ```

2. **Login to ATM**:
   - You run `ATM.java`, input your account details (holder name, account number, password, and the 4-digit ATM code only once during the first login).
   - If all details match, you successfully log in and can perform ATM operations like:
     - Withdraw money
     - Check balance
     - Deposit money
